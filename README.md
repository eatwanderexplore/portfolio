# portfolio

This is my portfolio website for projects created within the Codecademy Full-stack development path. I may also include other projects I've worked on as well. 

I used html, css, and javascript to build the website. The javascript is used for the dropdown menu in the navigation bar.

At the time of creating this, it was a challenge to get the dropdown menu to show properly and appear in the correct place - under the Projects link - and not off to one side of the page. I learned a lot about tweaking the css to change the appearance of the website and make it look the way I wanted it.
